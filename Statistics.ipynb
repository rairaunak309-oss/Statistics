        "#Q1. What is the difference between descriptive statistics and inferential statistics? Explain with examples?\n",
        "Ans1. Descriptive statistics are methods for summarizing and organizing data so it can be easily understood.\n",
        "Example: A teacher records test score of her class of 30 students.\n",
        "Average score = 75\n",
        "Highest score = 95\n",
        "Lowest score = 50\n",
        "Standard deviation = 10\n",
        "These numbers describe the actual performance of that specific class only.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inferential statistics use a sample of data to make predictions, conclusions, or generalization about a larger population.\n",
        "Example: A researcher surveys 200 voters to predict the outcome of a national election.\n",
        "60% of the sample favors Candidate A.\n",
        "Using inferential statistics, they estimate that around 60% +- 3% of the entire population will favore Candidate A.\n",
        "Here the researcher is using a sample to make a conclusion about a whole population.\n",

        "#Q2. What is sampling in statistics? Explain the difference between random and stratified sampling?\n",
        "Ans2. Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals (sample) from a larger group (population) to study and make conclusions about the population.\n",
        "In Random sampling every individual has an equal chance of being selected. It is used when the population is fairly homogeneous. It is simple, unbaised and easy to perform. Example, choosing 100 students randomly from a university list.\n",
        "In Stratified sampling population is divided into subgroups based on characterestics, then samples are taken from each stratum. It is used when population is heterogenous. It is more accurate but more complex and requires prior knowledge of population characterestics. Example, dividing students according to their streams like sceince, commerce, arts, etc.\n",

        "Median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order.\n",
        "Mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the dataset.\n",

        "Ans4. Skewness measures the asymmetry in a data distribution. In positive skew tail is longer on the right side. Most data values are low but a few very high values pull the mean upward.\n",
        "Kurtosis measures the tailedness or peakedness of a distribution.\n",
        "A positively skewed distribution means the tail extends to the higher right side, the mean > median > mode. Most observations are clustered on the left, with some extreme large values on the right. Real life examples include income, house prices, hospital stay lengths.\n",
